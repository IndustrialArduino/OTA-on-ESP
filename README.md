# OTA-on-ESP

This project demonstrates how to perform Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates on an ESP32 using a WiFi connection and ESP32 using  SIM7500. By uploading the latest firmware to a GitHub repository, the ESP32 can periodically check for updates and download them over WiFi or GPRS, ensuring that the device always runs the most recent version of the firmware.
